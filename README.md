# code-maker-breaker (*Unsupported*)

## Purpose
I wanted to create a simple webpage that can take plain text and translate it into UTF 16 code. I also wanted the ability to take any UTF 16 code and translate that into text.

### *Notes*

The UTF 16 decoder must be comma delimited e.g. *"97,115,100 ..."*. If it is not input in this way, the funciton will not work properly.
